Change Log:

3.04
      1) Changes to irrxml functions; 
         added main.set_sideband <USB/LSB>
         added log.set_call <CALL>
      2) Change to macro timer implementation - bug fix for Windows
      3) Fixed bug in WFaveraging - save configuration
      4) Fixed ARQ tcpip bugs when used with pskmail
      5) Added end of transmit feedback to ARQ client when transmit is stopped
         from within fldigi (T/R button pressed).
      6) XML-RPC fixes & simplification of XML-RPC error handling.
	  7) Added simple XML-RPC access control with three new switches
  		     --xmlrpc-allow REGEX  only allow matching methods
             --xmlrpc-deny REGEX   ignore matching methods
             --xmlrpc-list         list methods
         For example: fldigi --xmlrpc-deny 'main.tx|main.run_macro' or the
         shorter 'main.(tx|run_macro)' will unregister those two methods.
         Add --xmlrpc-list after an allow or deny switch to verify the results.
      8) Added thread signal handling with SIGUSR2 to stop the xmlrpc and 
         arq-socket threads and avoid the socket accept/timeout loop.
      9) Removed fl_thread wrappers to direct pthread calls
      10) Added various Qrunner updates
      11) Added rig control freq entry.  Click on Frequency Control widget for
          focus.  Enter digits in kHz.kHz.  <Enter> to use new value, <Esc> to
          cancel.
      12) Added qsy function.  Moved the hamlib/rigcat/etc qsy if/else block 
          into its own function and replaced all instances of that code.
      13) Add waterfall mouse options
            a) Added Mouse tab to the W-fall tab(s).
            b) Added waterfall qsy option, which works well with rigcat and 
               hamlib (direct and rpc.rigd).
            c) Added text field whose contents are appended to the RX window 
               when the frequency is changed via a waterfall left click.
               The text will be printed by strftime if it contains any 
               % characters, so it's possible to specify something like
               "<=== %x %H:%M ====>" for the RX divider line.
      14) Deprecated the "rtty is USB" configuration item.  fldigi adjusts
          all tone inversion sensitive modes for USB / LSB operation.
      15) Changes to command parsing used by the ARQ interface(s); TLF, SysV
          and ARQ socket.
      16) Reduced the minimum main window height.
      17) Added fldigi-shell time command
            Try this "stress test":
            time eval for (1..50) 
            { execute("modem.set_by_name BPSK31"); \
              execute("modem.set_by_name RTTY"); }
      18) Added brief message to the opening Rx text area indicating which
          macro file was loaded on start up.  This is a configurable item on
          the Misc/Macro tab
      19) Addition of Navy MARS prosigns to the CW Morse encoder / decoder.
      20) Add new option to dock a digiscope and deprecate command line switch
      21) Add option to change waterfall mouse wheel handling. Adapt patch
          by Stephane F8CFE to change rig frequency via the mouse wheel.
      22) Added <IDLE>NNN macro tag; causes signal to idle for NNN seconds
          before sending macro text.  Use:
          
          <TX><IDLE>05
          Now is the time for all good men
          <RX><TIMER>20
          
          will generate 5 seconds of idle, the text, and repeat after 20 sec's.
      23) Added new configuration options to set the waterfall width and height
          These and the docked digiscope configuration option require a program
          restart to take effect.
      24) Added rig control widgets to the main dialog qso panel.
      25) Added icons for many of the menu items.  The menus now have both an 
          icon and a text where appropriate.
      26) Added a check box for "Nag me about log entries".
      27) Added a double click on waterfall functionality.  This will write a 
          special string to the Rx text window such as:

          <<2008-10-30T23:25Z BPSK-31 @ 3580000+1474>>

          This record is then accessible using the mouse in the Rx text window.  
          You can then left click on the string and fldigi will change mode, 
          rf frequency (if CAT), and audio frequency to the saved record.

          The text field associated with "Insert on left click" (W-fall/Mouse 
          tab) allows you to modify this behavior.  You enter the following for
          the left click insertion text: <FREQ> and the double click changes 
          to a single left click.
      28) Added QSO data mouse binding.  Binds Rx text mouse-2 (right mouse 
          button) to a handler that enters QSO data into the log fields. A 
          limited amount of pattern matching is done to recognize RST reports 
          and IARU locator strings. The text is meant to be middle-clicked 
          roughly in the order in which it tends to appear in QSOs: 
          callsign RST name QTH locator.  The other shortcuts (menu items and 
          Shift-click work as before).
      29) Fixed IZDT time format. The timezone only makes sense in ILDT. With 
          IZDT, it is always +0000, so we should be using "Z". This applies to 
          macros which use the <ZDT> and <IZDT> tags.

3.03
      1) Changes to socket server to correct shutdown process
      2) Added event logging and an event viewer
      3) Added QRZ cdrom / database location specifier with auto-search
      4) Bug fix for sound on OS X 10.4
      5) Bug fix for Socket Server. Added error checking for listen().
      6) Update to build scripts.  Corrected compiler flags for building 
         universal binary on OS X. Changed to a more reliable way of linking 
         hamlib statically.  Updated app bundling script.
      7) Set tooltip font - tooltip changed to use same font and size selected
         with the command line switch --font.  Set default font sizes on OS X.
      8) Inhibit Tx / Rx of higher speed MFSKpic modes on slower computers
      9) Added color selection for Rx/Tx text panels
             Normal text
             Transmitted text
             Control character text
             Skipped text
             Alternate (quick view) text
             Background
      10) Changed the way that RTS/DTR PTT is used with rig.xml files
      11) Updated regular expression parser
      12) Modified <EXEC> passing of fd's to child processes
      13) Changed "no color" buttons to background vice background2 (white).
          Setting -bg <color> on command line switch now controls the "no color"
          value for the macro buttons.
      14) Fixed macro timer to properly reset if <TIMER> re-invoked during
          timeout period.
      15) Fixed broken access to on-line subscriber Hamlog data base
      16) Removed trailing spaces from frequency field in ADIF file
      17) Changes to rigio thread loop to disable reads during transmit
      18) Improved serial port discovery
      19) Added History replay option - when enabled; right click on waterfall
          replays audio history buffer.
      20) OS X resize handle / button overlay fixed
      21) Modified sound port Event Log message.
      22) Added Callsign to Title Bar "NO CALLSIGN SET" if the MyCallsign is
          void.
      23) Added "log.clear" to xmlrpc command set - clears the data in the
          logbook fields.
      24) If compiled into the executable the xmlrpc server is always started.
          ARQ server is also started.  Both can be serviced concurrently.
      24) Increased RTTY cross-hair scope sensitivity
      25) Modified Generate/Playback file to be closer to Capture in signal
          level.
      26) Modified "view transmit" signal level to be closer in amplitude to
          Rx signal level.
      27) Fixed XMLRPC bug in mode.set_by_id and mode.set_by_name calls
      28) Added $LOC locator field to <EXEC>...</EXEC> calls for return
          values ($NAME $QTH $LOC).
      29) Added "tlf", The Left Foot, contest program support.  fldigi accepts
          tx data and returns rx data to tlf. (Linux primarily).
      
3.02
      1) Added hamlib interface for rig control
      2) Improved rigCAT serial communications on Windows

3.01
      1) Compile switch changes for OS-X
      2) Corrected serial port discovery on Windows
      
3.0   1) Added EXEC macro
      2) Added mousewheel over Macro buttons to move between macro button sets.
      3) Fixed bug in Olivia signal level display.
      4) Ported to Windows (win32) and OS-X
      5) Added floating digiscope and / or fixed scope abutting waterfall
         specified with command line switch --twoscopes
         Default is floating digiscope without the fixed scope
      6) Added save as png to mfsk-pic reception
      7) Added RTTY Baudot Unshift-On-Space configuration for Rx and Tx
      8) Modified mouse wheel handler to accommodate horizontal or vertical 
         squelch slider.
      9) Call scopeview->size_range when the floating digiscope changes mode;
         so that the phase and crosshair rtty scope should maintain aspect 
         ratio.
     10) Modified the Ctrl+Left/Right mouse button combo to not drag the marker.
     11) Deprecate the --resample switch in favour of the new menu in the Audio
         Settings tab. Move sound initialisation code out of configuration.cxx
         and into soundconf.cxx. Make Native the default sample rate selection.
     12) Changed the main window's callback and the File->Exit handler to not
         exit() but, rather, hide the windows so that Fl::run will return and
         main can clean up. (fix for Sig 11 faults at exit).
     13) Rename jpeg.m4 to images.m4 and extend it to also detect libpng. Make
         both libraries optional. Add new optional fourth argument to the file
         selector functions, used to determine file format regardless of
         filename suffix.
     14) New sound callback code implementation.
     15) Two-colour squelch button shows Yellow Squelch enabled but not open,
         Light Green enabled and open.
     16) Experimental RTTY mark/space cross hair display using mark / space
         filters.
     17) Psk phase scope: 3 modes selectable by multiple left clicks on face
         of digiscope.
           1) original single vector display
           2) fading fixed length vector display
           3) fading variable length vector display; length proportional to
              signal quality.
     18) Completely new DominoEX decoder - similar in theory to ZL2AFP
         DominoEX, which has FFT bin resolution 4x the tone spacing.  No AFC is
         required for proper tracking of the Rx signal.
     19) Removed ZOH and Linear interpolator choices from the resampling choice
         menu under Sound Card configuration.
     20) Fixed a bug in the global.cxx structures.  Missing field in "CW"
         definition.
     21) Added Latency setting for waterfall FFT.  Latency relates to the
         amount of signal that is shared between waterfall scans.  A higher
         latency gives better resolution in frequency and blurriness in time
         (waterfall drop).  A lower latency gives better resolution in time
         and less in frequency.  The waterfall accuracy is still related to the
         FFT size and that remains fixed for an accuracy of 1 Hz.
     22) Added MultiPsk, DominoEX-FEC modes
     23) Added new modem type DEX (Domino Extended), an FEC only Domino mode
         that supports the full ASCII character set in the primary and the
         printable ASCII English character set (less control codes) in the
         secondary.
     24) Use Fl_Preferences for the status
         The new status filename is ~/.fldigi/status to avoid breaking older
         versions.
     25) Stacktrace updates - Some cosmetic changes to the output. Stack and 
         version info no longer printed twice when a signal is caught.
     26) Use PortAudio extensions - Probes for PortAudio extensions with 
         dlopen. right now the only extension used is the one that changes the
         JACK client name.
     27) Updated PulseAudio code so that non-ppm resampling is performed by
         PulseAudio when that sound i/o system is used.
     28) Changed the capture resampling code for PortAudio and PulseAudio to
         use libsamplerate's callback API.
     29) Use fileselect filter values.  Made the audio format independent of 
         the filename suffix in the generate/capture/playback code; 
         uses the fileselector filter value instead.
     30) Update fileselector - Fileselector now remembers previous directory.
     31) MFSK bug fixes. The "broken image transmit" was due to stopflag not 
         being initialised in the mfsk ctor. Image window processing changed
         to clearing the widget before redrawing the window.
     32) Fix crash with missing mixer device - Call OpenMixer in a try block 
         and handle the exception.
     33) Changed DominoEX-FEC secondary char lookup to a std::map type.
     34) Corrected two coding errors which produced compile warnings in
         dominoex.cxx and mt63base.cxx
     35) Bug fixes for the FM Hell modes
     36) Changed the way that the video text / id is generated.
     37) Added XML-RPC support.
     38) Added Audio Device identification display (on Help menu)
     39) Added transmit & receive Reed Solomon mode identifier.  Automatic
         detection, mode change and frequency centering during receive.
         ID sent at beginning of each transmission (toggled on Misc tab).
     40) Fixed bug in waterfall update method that could cause a seg fault 
         under certain conditions.
     41) Change to PortAudio samplerate probing.
     42) Increased average power level in MT-63 mode.
     43) Significantly decreased cpu usage with changes to qrunner and complex 
         classes.
     44) Forced audio-in channel on PortAudio and PulseAudio to 1 channel (left)
         to accommodate Vista MME interface.

2.10.3)
      1) Corrected memory leak bug.
2.10.2
      1) Bug fix for QRZ CDROM access
2.10.1
      1) Fixed bug in MODEM macro that caused TX to hang
      2) Fixed sound_init crash.  This would happen with an empty 
         progdefaults.OSSdevice (e.g. new install) on a system without 
         OSS devices.
      3) Deleted local copy of libsamplerate as it was deprecated.
      4) Deleted the fast text widgets that were a part of the early versions
         of fldigi and had been retained for some performance improvement.
         Recent changes to the more complete text widgets have equalled the
         performance of the fast text widgets.
2.10  1) Added history decoding (ctrl-Left-click in waterfall). Available after
         tracking has started.  This does not start a new signal acquisition.
      2) Rewrote Psk and ViewPsk to use shared signal detection class
      3) Made OSS optional and added autoconf macro to detect its presence
      4) The volume sliders will now be hidden if the mixer is disabled
      5) Added a <MODEM> macro that changes the current modem
      6) Added "Log File" status to saved application state
      7) Added "use default audio device" if h/w changes
      8) Fixes to ringbuffer / audio backends
      9) Fixes to mfsk picture mode decoding
     10) Changed frequency2 data file format, downward compatible
     11) Added HELL80, FELD_SLOWHELL, FELD_HELLX5 and FELD_HELLX9 modems
     12) Added Pulse Audio support with support for separate capture and
         playback devices and sample rates
     13) Added mt63 500/1000/2000 modes
     14) Added psk acquisition level control
     15) Rename some classes so that fldigi builds on Mac OSX.
         Added script to create .app bundles on OS X
         Many thanks to Justin Burket and Diane Bruce.
     16) Rx-slider, Tx-slider, Squelch-slider values added to the saved
         application state.
     17) Increased number of macros to 48.  F11 & F12 now accessible by mouse
         or keyboard.  Alt Function key button changed to rotate forward (left-
         click) and rotate reverse (right-click) through macro sets.
     18) New color and font selection dialog - Rx / Tx widgets and macro button
         background colors are user selectable

2.09  1) Modified src/Makefile.am for FreeBSD name space clash
      2) Added psk multi-channel viewer with regex search capability
      3) Rewrote audio capture/playback/generate routines to use the
         libsndfile C API. Added .au support (32bit floats, host endianness)

2.08  1) Changes to build process:
	     a. Use PortAudio's C API; the C++ bindings are no longer required
         b. Boost is no longer required when std::(tr1::)bind is available,
            as is the case with g++ >= 4.0
         c. Autodetect TLS support
         d. Use std::bind (or std::tr1::bind) if available. 
         e. Add m4 macros for TLS autodetection (the --enable-tls/--disable-tls 
            switches are still supported).
         f. Minor changes to configure.ac
      2) qrunner cleanups
      3) New ringbuffer and other utility code
      4) New item in the sample rate menu: "Native" selects the hardware's 
         preferred sample rate. Breaks backward compatibility: saving this 
         with fldigi-2.08 will result in an "invalid sample rate" message if 
         the same fldigi_def.xml file is then used with 2.07 -- until "Auto" 
         or a specific value is selected again.
      5) Correction to the waterfall's "casual tuning" feature: don't set the 
         modem to SIGSEARCH when the right mouse button is released.
      6) Set locale only for LC_TIME
      7) Add .desktop, move icons to data/; for deb / rpm build compatibility
      8) Exception trapping and print to stdout on program failure 
      9) Fixes to modem class logic:
         a. Olivia  Corrected uninitialized variables.
         b. MFSK    Corrected uninitialized variables. Fixed memory leak.
         c. CW      Corrected uinitialized variable. 
         d. Throb   Fix memory leak caused by using the wrong delete operator.
         e. PSK     Corrected uninitialized variables.
     10) Rigcat/Hamlib dialog.  Added mode, sideband, and current audio
         frequency to "saved" frequencies list.

2.07  1) bug fix for mode changes via SysV interface (pskmail / flarq)
      2) bug fix for modem configuration post quick change from status
         bar using mouse wheel.
2.06  1) Source code fixes for 64 bit compilers
      2) New stacktrace code, used by default exception & signal handlers
      3) LDT / ZDT: locale settings are now recognized in macro expansion.
         New ILDT / IZDT macros to expand date in iso-8601 format
      4) The rig control window's frequency list now stores rig mode, modem and
         waterfall carrier. Hence, ~/.fldigi/frequencies.txt uses a new format
      5) Additional mouse wheel function: when pointer is over the digiscope
         display, the mouse wheel (no key modifier) alters the PSK AFC search
         range, FeldHell filter BW, or CW filter BW
      6) The Audio menu is now a submenu of Files
2.05  1) Converted entire make system over to the GNU autoconf / automake
         format.  See the INSTALL file for additional information
      2) Corrected various minor bugs
      3) Added mouse wheel functions when mouse is in waterfall display
         a) click - toggle AFC
         b) shift - alter SQL level
         c) ctrl - alter PSK search range.
      4) modified waterfall cursors to show the search range
2.04  1) added full waterfall video texting using FeldHell Modern-8-14 font.
         1, 2, 3 or 4 characters per video line.
      2) bug fix for center mouse button toggle of AFC.
      3) added option to insert CW identifier at end of transmission
2.03  1) bug fix for new startup Sound Card / Mixer naming on configuration tab.
      2) bug fix for initial startup frequency
      3) bug fix for homedir discovery
2.02  1) additional fixes for extended text widgets

         b) Modem startup problem when switching modes.
         c) crlf fix for received characters
         d) scrollbar fix for extended text widgets         	  
2.0   1) Increased TxPPM to +/- 50000 to match the RxPPM range
      2) Changed all audio i/o to separate 2 channel control (stereo)
      3) Added right channel CW QRQ signal
      4) Added right channel pseudo FSK signal
      5) Added position and size of main dialog to state memory

      7) Added PSKmail tab and control to allow disabling the automatic
         return to the PSK sweet spot if running a mail server
      8) Added "Save To" menu item on received text popup menu.
      9) Corrected memory leak bugs found in version 1.34
      10) Added "Test" capability to save Rx or Tx waveforms in ".wav"
          format and to play them back for testing modem decoders.
      11) Replaced text editing widgets with new widgets capable of cut,
          copy and paste. 
          ===> temporarily disabled pending resolution of cpu% problem
      12) Added new functions on text widget popup menus
      13) Added a QSY undo (right button press)
      14) Added a who is this capability to waterfall -- press right
          button and hold on a signal and decoding occurs on that signal.
          Release and decoding returns to normal tracking point.
      15) This release requires libsndfile, libportaudio and libportaudiocpp
          The new libraries provide portaudio sound card mapping, and the
          ability to save and playback wav files (when fldigi is run as:
          fldigi TEST).
      16) Added Azimuth computation to QRZ query (submitted by WA5ZNU).
      17) Corrected adif file header field <PROGRAMID:6>fldigi
      18) Added fix to psk decoder sync detector.  Thanks to the PocketDigi
          author, Vojtech Bubnik, OK1IAK.
      19) Added popup menu (right click) to the lower left corner modem button.
          Allows quick change on psk modes only.  Left button still opens up
          the configuration tab for the modem in use.
      20) Changed QRZ.com query to XML registered user query, see QRZ config-
          uration tab.
      21) Added grunner and boost libraries.  These separate the modem threads
          from the gui thread.  This provides a considerable improvement in
          modem performance.
      22) Restored the new text editing widgets and also retained the fast
          text widgets that do not have full editing capability.  User can
          select which of the text widgets will be used.  Default is the fast
          text widget.  An fldigi restart is required after making a change to
          the widget selection on the "misc" configuration tab.
      23) Multiple changes to hamlib interface to correct deficient behavior on
          startup and when changing frequency.
      24  Changes to several modem code structures associated with qrunner
          implementation.
      25) Text widgets support additional text styles:
		  	 NATTR : FOREGROUND_COLOR
			 XMIT  : FL_RED  - used in Rx widget to show Xmt'd text
			 CTRL  : FL_DARK_RED - used in Rx/Tx widgets for control chars
			 SKIP  : FL_BLUE - used in Rx/Tx for skipped chars (eg: Tx ON/OFF)
			 ALTR  : FL_DARK_GREEN - used in Rx widget for quick view of signal
			         when right-clicking on a waterfall signal
      26) Added additional control/mode commands to the pskmail/ARQ SYSV 
          message queue processor.  Mode command strings are now:
             CW          : <cmd><mode>CW</mode></cmd>
             DOMINO EX4  : <cmd><mode>DOMINOEX4</mode></cmd>
             DOMINO EX5  : <cmd><mode>DOMINOEX5</mode></cmd>
             DOMINO EX8  : <cmd><mode>DOMINOEX8</mode></cmd>
             DOMINO EX11 : <cmd><mode>DOMINOEX11</mode></cmd>
             DOMINO EX16 : <cmd><mode>DOMINOEX16</mode></cmd>
             DOMINO EX22 : <cmd><mode>DOMINOEX22</mode></cmd>
             MFSK8       : <cmd><mode>MFSK8</mode></cmd>
             MFSK16      : <cmd><mode>MFSK8</mode></cmd>
             PSK31       : <cmd><mode>PSK31</mode></cmd>
             PSK63       : <cmd><mode>PSK63</mode></cmd>
             PSK125      : <cmd><mode>PSK125</mode></cmd>
             PSK250      : <cmd><mode>PSK250</mode></cmd>
             RTTY        : <cmd><mode>RTTY</mode></cmd>
             TUNE        : <cmd><mode>PTTTUNE</mode></cmd>
               this will cause fldigi to enter the TUNE mode for a very brief
               100 milliseconds.
      27) Abandoned the original fldigi.def configuration file and changed to
          an xml based configuration file.  New file is 
          $HOME/.fldigi/fldigi_def.xml
          You may delete all occurances of 
              $HOME/.fldigi/fldigi.def, and
              $HOME/.fldigi/FLDIGI_XML.DEF
          Future changes to the configuration should never require deleting the
          old configuration file.
          You will need to reconfigure and save the program configuration the 
          first time the new version of fldigi is executed.
      28) Added numerous command line switches which control the look and feel.
          use "fltk --help" from a terminal window to view the switch options.

1.34  1) Cleaned up unused code segments
      2) Modified CW decoder to allow setting upper and lower limits on
         Tx WPM
      3) Modified sound card PPM corrections to allow a +/-50000 range.
         Prompted by some users reporting ppm requirements exceeding
         25,000 ppm at 8000 Hz sample rate.  Same card gives < 200 ppm
         at 11025.
      4) Modified the combo widget to allow both editable and non-editable
         forms.
         The combo widget for the rig selection cannot be edited, but just
         selected from the pick list.
         The combo widget for the frequency entry (no rig control) in the 
         qso area can now be modified by direct keyboard entry and also 
         from the pick list.  You still need to update the pick list via
         the $HOME/.fldigi/frequencies.def file.
      5) Modified pskmail to test for failure in reading gmfsk_autofile
      6) Wholesale replacement of font browser dialog to correct potential
         segfaults with some TT fonts.
      7) Modified pskmail-to-fldigi i/o schema to allow all control and
         data files to be placed in either the 
         	$HOME/pskmail.files or the 
         	./ directory.
         The control files are:
         	PSKmailserver
         	PSKmailclient
         The data files are:
         	pskmail_out (formerly gmfsk_autofile)
         	mail-io.log (formerly gMFSK.log)
1.33  1) Modified Sound Card mixer dialog and interface code
      2) Modified CW decoder and morse speed tracking algorithm with a
         new CW configuration tab layout and new CW controls.

      3) all qso's saved to the log are appended to an ADIF file in the 
         $HOME/.fldigi folder
      4) significantly improved Psk decoder
      5) significantly improved DominoEX decoder    capable of decoding signals 
         anywhere within a 400 Hz bandwidth without AFC

1.24  1) Bug fix for serial i/o to disable XON/XOFF protocol effected 
         rigs with binary i/o for rig control

1.20  1) Improved rig control and rig control dialog. Now possible to 
         control rig without using hamlib - this is a new paradigm and you 
         should read the on-line help that explains how to use the rigCAT 
         control interface.  rigCAT extended markup language definition files
         can be downloaded from the xml archives
      2) improved WWV calibration procedure
    
1.11  1) Added items to saved configuration
            a. view transmit signal preference
            b. send ID preference
      2) Corrected failure to properly change sound card selection after 
         initial program settings
      3) Internal changes to improve rx/tx thread processing

1.10  1) Added QRZ lookup for logging
      2) Updated CW / FSK keyling output, added UART generated FSK signals
      3) Added auto-logger macro reference to macro definitions
