Installation Instructions for fldigi
************************************

To compile fldigi you will need:

  * A recent C++ compiler.  The GNU C++ compilers in the 4.x series are
    known to work.

  * Version 1.3.4 or later of the Fast Light Tool Kit (FLTK), with its
    development library and headers.  FLTK's multi-threading support is
    required.

  * The samplerate (a.k.a. secret rabbit code) library.

  * The PNG library.

  * The libxft library.

You should read and follow the instructions for building on various OS
platforms that are on the fldigi wiki:

The simplest way to compile this package on Linux is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
     some messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.
