== NAME ==
fldigi - digital modem program for hamradio operators


== SYNOPSIS ==
*fldigi* ['OPTIONS']


== DESCRIPTION ==
*Fldigi* is a cross-platform multi-modem program for most of the digital modes
used by radio amateurs today: CW, PSK, MFSK, MT-63, RTTY, Hellschreiber,
DominoEX, Olivia, THOR and Throb are all supported. It can also help calibrate a
sound card to a time signal and do on-air frequency measurement tests.  Fldigi
features basic rig control, logging, and contest operation, ``panoramic'' PSK
decoding, a PSK Reporter client, and remote control via XML-RPC.


== OPTIONS ==
Long options begin with two hyphens and are handled by fldigi. The option names
may be abbreviated to any unambiguous substring, and the option argument may be
separated from the name by a space or equals sign, as per +getopt(3)+.

Short options begin with a single hyphen and are passed directly to FLTK. They
may be abbreviated only as indicated.

*--config-dir* 'DIRECTORY'::
  Look for and store configuration files in directory 'DIRECTORY', which is
  created if it does not exist. Defaults to ``$HOME/.fldigi''.

*--rx-ipc-key* 'KEY'::
  Set the receive message queue key. May be given in hex if prefixed with
  ``0x''.  Defaults to ``9876'' or ``0x2694''.

*--tx-ipc-key* 'KEY'::
  Set the transmit message queue key. May be given in hex if prefixed with
  ``0x''.  Defaults to ``6789'' or ``0x1a85''.

*--arq-server-address* 'HOSTNAME'::
  Set the ARQ TCP server address. Defaults to ``127.0.0.1''. 'HOSTNAME' may be
  any 'node name' string accepted by +getaddrinfo(3)+.

*--arq-server-port* 'PORT'::
  Set the ARQ TCP server port. Defaults to ``7322''. 'PORT' may be any 'service
  name' string accepted by +getaddrinfo(3)+.

[NOTE]
================================================================================
The '--xmlrpc-*' options are only available if fldigi was built with XML-RPC
support.
================================================================================

*--xmlrpc-server-address* 'HOSTNAME'::
  Set the XML-RPC server address. Defaults to ``127.0.0.1''.

*--xmlrpc-server-port* 'PORT'::
  Set the XML-RPC server port. Defaults to ``7362''.

*--xmlrpc-allow* 'REGEX'::
  Allow only the methods whose names match 'REGEX'. 'REGEX' is a POSIX extended
  regular expression.

*--xmlrpc-deny* 'REGEX'::
  Allow only the methods whose names do not match 'REGEX'.

*--xmlrpc-list*::
  List all available XML-RPC methods and exit. May be preceded by the
  '--xmlrpc-allow' or '--xmlrpc-deny' options to verify their effect.

*--cpu-speed-test*::
  Perform the CPU speed test that is normally done when fldigi is run without an
  existing configuration directory.  Results are shown in the event log and
  options may be changed to the recommended values for the measured CPU speed.

*--noise*::
  Unhide controls for adding noise to the transmitted signal.

*--wfall-only*::
  Hide all main window widgets except the menu bar and waterfall (with its
  associated controls). Meant to be used with external programs that control
  fldigi with XML-RPC.

*--debug-level* 'LEVEL'::
  Set the event log verbosity. 'LEVEL' is clamped to the range [0,5]; for
  'Quiet', 'Error', 'Warning', 'Info', 'Verbose' and 'Debug'.  Defaults to ``3''
  ('Info').

*--version*::
  Print version information and exit.

*--build-info*::
  Print build information and exit.

*--help*::
  Print options summary and exit.

== RESTRICTIONS ==
Fldigi is licensed under the GNU GPL, which grants you the right to run the
program for any purpose (freedom 0).  However, permission to use it for the
transmission of radio signals can only be obtained from the communications
authority of your country.  When given, this permission almost always comes in
the form of an amateur radio license.

If you do not have an amateur radio license you can still have fun using fldigi
as a shortwave listener. One way to do so is by using the builtin PSK Reporter
client to submit realtime spots of transmitting stations; see RESOURCES below.
All you need is a computer, homebrew SDR receiver, and simple wire antenna!


== FILES ==
Various files and subdirectories are created in $HOME/.fldigi. Some of the most
interesting ones are listed below.

fldigi_def.xml::
  The main settings file.

fldigi.prefs::
  The ``status'' file. Stores window geometries, button states, current modem,
  current audio frequency, squelch level, and so on.

status_log.txt::
  The event log.

macros/macros.mdf::
  The default macro file.

palettes/::
  This directory contains waterfall palettes.

scripts/::
  This directory is added to the PATH environment variable of the child process
  that runs <EXEC> macros.

logs/::
  This directory contains logged received and sent text (when such logging is
  enabled), including the default logbook database, logbook.adif.

images/::
  Received MFSK images are automatically saved in this directory.

freqanalysis.csv::
  This file is written by the frequency analysis modem. The fields are dial
  frequency, audio frequency, and offset. See documentation for details.

[NOTE]
================================================================================
The following files are used if present.  They must be downloaded and copied
to ~/.fldigi/ by the user.
================================================================================

cty.dat::
  List of DXCC entities and callsign prefixes; used to display tooltips in the
  received text buffer, and also to auto-fill the Country, Locator and Azimuth
  log fields. Available at http://www.country-files.com/cty/.

lotw1.txt::
  List of known LOTW users (one callsign per line); used for the received text
  tooltips. Available at http://www.hb9bza.net/lotw/.

AGMemberList.txt or eqsl.txt::
  List of ``Authenticity Guaranteed'' eQSL users (one callsign per line); used
  for the received text tooltips. Available at
  http://www.eqsl.cc/QSLcard/Programming.cfm.


== EXAMPLES ==
+fldigi --wfall-height 144 --font sans:11 -fg "#c0c0c0" -bg "#5f5f63" -bg2 "#19213b"+::

  Unregister XML-RPC methods that may transmit.

+ssh -L 7362:localhost:7362 remote-host xvfb-run fldigi -display :99+::
  Start fldigi on 'remote-host' under a ``fake'' X server.  (The +xvfb-run(1)+
  utility is available on Debian systems).  The remote ``headless'' fldigi is
  then controlled via XML-RPC on port 7362, e.g. using +fldigi-shell(1)+.

+fldigi --benchmark-input 480000 --benchmark-modem 1+::
  Benchmark the DominoEX-4 modem with 480K audio samples.

+fldigi --benchmark-input audio.wav --benchmark-modem 25 --benchmark-frequency 1500 --benchmark-afc 1 --benchmark-squelch 1 --benchmark-squelch-level 5.0 --benchmark-output out.txt+::
  Read 'audio.wav' (whose sample rate must be 8000Hz in this case) and decode
  BPSK-31 signals at 1500Hz.  AFC is enabled and the squelch is set to 5%.
  Decoded text is saved to 'out.txt'.
