Fldigi can also control a transceiver using Hamlib or RigCAT I/O, perform online
or cdrom QRZ queries, log QSOs with the built-in logbook or Xlog, and send
reception reports to the PSK Automatic Propagation Reporter.

If the Portaudio library is available then fldigi can process audio for
  . alert outputs for various event announcements
  . monitor and bandpass filter received audio
