\section rx_audio Receive audio

Setting the correct hardware, operating system, and fldigi received audio
levels is not difficult, but it is the one setup procedure most often done
incorrectly.  The most commonly used sound card devices contain either a
16 or 24 bit analog to digital (a/d) converter.  A 16 bit a/d can provide
approximately 90 db of signal conversion.  For the 16 bit converter, if the
peak audio signal that the a/d can handle is +/- 1 volt then the minimum
discernable signal (1 bit) will be +/- 30.5 microvolts.  If more than a +/- 1 volt
signal is applied to the a/d input then either one of two things may occur,
(1) the audio is clipped, or (2) the audio is wrapped, large positive signals
wrap to large negative signals and vice versa.

Signal decoding and signal display are two separate software processing paths:

The objective in adjusting the Rx audio is to use the full dynamic range of the
a/d without incurring overdrive.  fldigi provides a number of display controls to
assist in setting up the Rx audio.  There are two controls that adjust the
visual appearance of the waterfall.  These controls are below and to the 
left of the waterfall, "Upper signal level (dB)", and "Signal range (dB)".
The "Upper signal level" control is a gain control.  0 dB == x1,-6 dB = x2.
These values are dB relative to input signal level.  This control will effect 
the Waterfall, FFT, and SIGnal views.  The
"Signal range" control will only effect the Waterfall and FFT views.

Change the waterfall display to the "Scope" view.  Do this by pressing the 
"WF" button twice if it is currently displaying the waterfall.  You can also 
right click once on that button.  That button acts as a rotary and is left/right 
click sensitive.  The display should show what looks like an oscilloscope view 
of the received audio.  This is the entire audio signal and not just
the signal that is currently decoded.

If your sound card a/d (also referred to as codec) is functioning correctly there
should be no signal offset and the signal will be centered vertically about the x-axis.  Set your
transceiver to a portion of the band with digital signals, 14.070 MHz is a good spot.  Now adjust
the transceiver audio output and the operating system mixer controls so that the peak signals do
not exceed the upper/lower gray lines on the display.  The diamond indicator to the left of the
fldigi AFC button will be colored as follows:
<ul>
<li>BLACK - no signal present, or < 50 mv peak of audio</li>
<li>GREEN - signals are in the correct range, 50 mv to 900 mv peak audio</li>
<li>YELLOW - signals exceed 900 mv, but are less than 980 mv peak</li>
<li>RED - signals exceed 980 mv or 98% of maximum a/d capability</li>
</ul>

Set the left hand control to 0 dB and adjust the Rx audio (at the transceiver or OS mixer)
for about 1/2 scale on the SIG display for an S9 signal.  WWV or an AM station
carrier is a good signal to use for this adjustment.

You can then proceed to adjust the waterfall/fft appearance when you have the 
audio Rx level adjusted correctly.

The three signal views should be similar to this with the level/range controls set 
to 0 and 60 respectively.  The waterfall palette used is "default.pal", and the 
received signal is about 20 dB above the noise floor.

\section rx_win10 Windows Audio Properties
A combination of the Windows operating system and certain audio codecs needs to be accommodated.  The codecs
used by devices like the SignaLink-USB, the TS590S, and recent Icom transceivers are identified by the
Windows operating system as "microphone" devices.  The Windows mixer controls for that device
are then set to insert about 30 dB of gain in the signal path.  To compensate most users simply lower the
transceiver audio output.  The result is very poor decoding.  The correct procedure is to force the Windows
mixer controls to remove that 30 dB of gain.  This procedure is for Windows 10, but is similar on Windows 7,
and Windows 8.

Right click on the task bar speaker icon and select the "Recording devices" menu item.  This will open the
Sound devices dialog:

</center>
This is the dialog on my Windows 10 test computer with a SignaLink-USB connected to a USB hub.  The
SignaLink-USB shows up as a <b>Microphone</b> USB Audio CODEC.  Right click on the device entry and
select Properties.  This opens up the Microphone Properties dialog:
<center>
\image html win10-mic-properties.png "Microphone Properties"
\image latex win10-mic-properties.png "Microphone Properties" width=3.5in
</center>
Select the "Levels" tab and set the level to as close to 0 dB as is available:
<center>

</center>
Then select the "Advanced" tab and change the type of converter.

Apply and save the changes.  The last step is
usually needed to insure that the settings are not lost when the operating system is closed and restarted.


\section tx_audio Transmit audio

Too often you see an overdriven signals on the digital sub-bands;
multiple audio sidebands on PSK, splatter from overdriven MFSK and
RTTY. There is absolutely no reason for a transceiver driven
by fldigi to exhibit this type of performance. You can set up
your computer / transceiver for good solid performance without excessive
drive.
<br>

The "TUNE" button generates a continuous single frequency audio signal
at the exact frequency to which the waterfall cursor has been set. The peak
amplitude of this signal is the peak amplitude of every modem signal
generated by fldigi. None will exceed this value, even the simultaneous
multi-tone modes like Throb. Every modern SSB transmitter uses some automatic
level control ALC for preventing overdrive for SSB voice. A little overdrive
on a voice channel can be tolerated to a degree. In fact, that is what
an analog RF compressor does, overdrive and then subsequent filtering.
But you absolutely cannot tolerate that with the digital modes. Here is the
way to set up your transceiver for a clean signal. I recommend starting out
with a dummy load, but an "off hour" for a band might work just as well if
you do not have a dummy load.  If available, set the transceiver power level
control for maximum power output.  On my Icom 7100 and Yaesu FT991A that is
100 watts.
<br>

<ul>
<li>Make sure your transceiver's speech compression control is OFF</li>
<li>Set the operating system audio output mixer control to about 10% of 
full scale output.
<li>Set the fldigi transmit attenuator to -3 dB (control to the left of the AFC button)</li>
<li>Set the waterfall cursor to 1000 Hz</li>
<li>Enable the "Tune" mode in fldigi ... you do have CAT or PTT set up ...right?</li>
<li>Slowly bring up the Mixer audio output level until your rig's ALC just starts 
to function (a light blinking or a meter showing this condition).<br>
That will probably be at about 30 watts output if the transceiver is rated at 100 watts.
</li>
<li>Reduce the Mixer audio output until the ALC is disabled.</li>
<li>You are now transmitting at maximum output power without distortion.</li>
<li>You can use the fldigi transmit attenuator to make small adjustments 
in the output power to compensate for variations in the SSB transmit filter.</li>
</ul>

You can use any level below this and be assured that your output signal
will be clean. All digital signals that fldigi generates will be limited to
this peak-to-peak voltage. You should always use the minimum power necessary
to maintain good comms, remember that even if you are clean at 100 W you
signal will be so strong among the QRP signals that it will overpower the
AGC on many receivers that are working another digital station within the
same SSB bandwidth that you are on. You will appreciate this the first
time that you are working a weak PSK DX station and someone blasts through
and captures your AGC.
<br>

You should try the the above adjustments at different audio
frequencies. Transceivers that achieve the SSB filtering with crystal or
mechanical filters will have a considerable amount of variation across the
passband of the filter. This will show up as a varying amount of ALC that is
dependent on the audio frequency. Once you are comfortable with the process
you can very quickly repeat the "Tune" and set the power for the frequency
to which the waterfall is set.  The fldigi transmit attenuator control should
have sufficient range to compensate for transmit SSB filter variation.  You
do not want to transmit (or receive) near the cutoff frequencies of the SSB
filter.  The transceiver filter will introduce both phase and amplitude
distortion over the signal bandwidth.
