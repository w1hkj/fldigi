The following macro tags will be parsed and acted upon then they occur
during the transmission of the macro.
<br>

 Tag                       | Description
:------------------------: | :-----------------
\<!WPM:NN\>                | CW words per minute
\<!POST:+/-nn.n\>	       | CW post delay
\<!PRE:nn.n\>	           | CW pre delay
\<RISE:nn.n\>\<RISE:nn.n\> | CW rise/decay time
\<!MODEM: ,...\>           | Change to specified modem with parameters
\<!GOHOME\>	               | Move audio carrier to mode sweet spot frequency
\<!GOFREQ:NNNN\>	       | Move audio carrier to specific audio frequency
\<!QSY:FFF.F[:NNNN]\>      | Move to specific RF and Audio frequency
\<!IDLE:NN.nn\>	        | Transmit idle signal for specified number of seconds
\<!WAIT:NN\>	           | Wait (no audio) for specified number of seconds
\<!WPM:ww[:ff]\>	       | CW - ww = WPM, optional ff = Farnsworth wpm

<br>

Note that each of these tags is identical to their immediate mode
counterparts.  The exception is the addition of the exclamation
mark following the leading '\<'.  The use of these tags is best
explained by example.

  <li>Modem type is changed to CW before start of transmission (\<MODEM:CW\>)

  <li>Audio carrier is changed to 600 Hertz</li>
  <li>Transmit WPM set to 30 words per minute, followed by text</li>
  <li>Transmit is silent for 2 seconds</li>
  <li>Rise time, pre and post delays are adjusted and the WPM changed to 180
  words per minute</li>
  <li>Text is sent at 180 WPM</li>
  <li>WPM changed to 30 words per minute, followed by identification string
  and signoff</li>
  <li>Return to receive</li>
</ul>

This is a more complex macro that might be used for a code practice
transmission such as the W1AW broadcast on 3580 KHz.<br>

\section advanced_qsy Advanced QSY operations

Several QSY frequencies or ranges of frequencies provided by one increment,
can be proposed, in which case the first frequency after the current
frequency is chosen.

<ul>
  <li>Change modem type to NULL to suppress transmission and start the Tx
  data stream processor</li>
  <li>Send frequency change command to transceiver, new frequency is
3594 kHz, audio frequency 915 Hz. Note that this puts the MARK tone at
1000 Hz.</li>
  <li>Change modem to RTTY 170 Hz shift, 45.45 baud (default is 5 bits).
  Idle for 2 seconds.</li>
  <li>Send the file contents of specified file</li>
  <li>Change to NULL modem.  Turns off the RTTY diddle ... audio stream is
  silent.</li>
  <li>Change audio frequency to 1000 Hz.  Idle for 5 seconds (complete
  silence of transmit)</li>
  <li>Change modem type to BPSK-31.  Send BPSK idle for 2 seconds</li>
  <li>Send the file contents of specified file</li>
  <li>Return to receive (note that the \<TX\> can appear anywhere
is the macro definition as it is executed when the macro text is
parsed).  \<RX\> is always moved to the end of the Tx
buffer.  It could also have appeared anywhere in the macro string.</li>

This is the contents of the ARRL broadcast macro text at the time the
macro button is pressed.  Each of the \<!... macro tags has been
specified by the string "^!" which the Tx processor interprets as the
command to process the top most tag in the first-in, first-out sequence
of tags.  As each "^!" is executed the referenced tag is printed
to the Rx buffer using color coded text.<br>
