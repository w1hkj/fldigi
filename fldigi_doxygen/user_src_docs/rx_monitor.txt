The rx monitor shares the the audio output device with the "audio alert" system.  The rx monitor volume
can be independently controlled.  Enable "Monitor ON" to listen to the rx audio on the audio-alert sound device.  
Insert the DSP filter by enabling "Filtered audio".

The DSP center frequency, bandwidth, low cutoff, and high cutoff can be controlled.  These four controls interact.  You
will probably find it most convenient to use the bandwidth, BW, and center frequency, Mid, controls.  Change any one of the four 
controls and the other three will track.  You can also elect to have the center frequency track the waterfall cursor.<br>
<ul>
<li>Bandwidth is adjustable from 50 to 4000 Hz in 10 Hz steps</li>
<li>Center frequency is adjustable from 400 to 3500 in 10 Hz steps</li>
<li>Low frequency is adjustable from 100 to 3500 in 10 Hz steps</li>
<li>High frequency is adjustable from 500 to 4000 in 10 Hz steps</li>
</ul>
