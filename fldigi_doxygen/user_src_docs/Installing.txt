The developers recommend that you build either fldigi from source or install
from the repository associated with your distribution.  The repository may
not be immediately available for the most current version number.  In that
case you can try installing the binary distribution.  Keep in mind that the
version numbers of the dependent shared libraries must match those on the
machine used to create the binary.

The source code for fldigi is very large and has a number of dependencies
that must be satisfied before a successful compile.  If you are not familiar
with compiling and linking source code you should probably practice on a
simpler package before treading these waters. Please refer to the following
web site for information on building for
Linux, Windows and OS X.
