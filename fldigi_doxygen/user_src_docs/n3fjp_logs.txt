Please see \ref n3fjp_logger "Contesting with N3FJP logger connection" for detailed information
on the setup of the fldigi logging interface with N3FJP logging programs.

\section n3fjp_ACL N3FJP ACL

<b>Capturing Rx text in fldigi</b>

The fldigi user can capture text, both word delimited and mouse 
high-lighted from the received text panel. The text will capture either 
with a double-left or single-left mouse click. This is selectable on
this fldigi configuration tab:

\image html single-click.png ""
\image latex single-click.png "" width=5.0in
<br>
Single-click is faster, but makes marking text a bit more difficult, 
especially if the text is being moved vertically as it is being decoded.
I hardly ever mark-bound a text to capture, so I prefer the single-click
paradigm.

The behavior of the left-click transfer is dependent on whether fldigi is 
configured for casual contacts or contesting (include field day). The word 
capture for both casual and contesting will always transfer a recognized 
CALL to the fldigi logging entry for CALL. Call recognition uses a 
Regular Expression Parser.

A word that passes the rules for RST will be transferred to the RSTin entry.

A word that passes the rules for Maidenhead locater (grid square) will be 
transferred to the Loc entry.

For casual contacts, the fields are then populated in order: NAME, QTH.

Contest fields are populated in a similar way for CALL. If the contest 
fields for Xchg are visible then the left click paradigm is to append 
each clicked word LEFT to RIGHT with a space separator to the XchngIn 
entry control.

If the  Field Day contest fields CLASS and SECTION are visible then the 
left-clicked Rx text words will be entered in that order.

Capturing the Field Day values for CALL, CLASS and SECTION can take as 
few as 3 mouse clicks.

<b>Trigger Actions</b>

Immediately after the call field is updated, the CALLTAB command is sent 
to ACL. This doesn't actually change focus in ACL, but performs all the 
functions associated with tabbing from the Call field in ACL, including 
duplicate check, listing previous contacts and retrieving previous contact 
info. In ACL, it also initiates call book lookup (if enabled), checks 
Watch List, etc.

This action takes place when:

<ul>
<li>fldigi's log call field is populated from the Rx text transfer</li>
<li>fldigi's log call field is exited via ENTER or TAB key</li>
</ul>

The TXTENTRY in ACL will change whenever a 3 or more keystrokes occurs in 
the fldigi log call field, or when the log call field is populated from 
the Rx text grab.

Clearing the fldigi log fields will clear the N3FJP call fields

Clearing the fldigi log call field using the right-click-clear paradigm 
will clear the N3FJP call fields

\section n3fjp_fd_contest_log N3FJP FD Contest

You will need to perform some additional configuration in fldigi to fully 
appreciate the data capture and FD event logging.  Open the Contest 
configuration tab and make the following entries: FD operator CALL, your CLASS,
your SECTION.

\section n3fjp_cqww_contest N3FJP CQWW RTTY Contest logger

Select the CQWW contest on the Contest configuration tab.  The fields for 
CQzone and CQstate are then visible, as are the respective Rx text, right click
popup menu items.
