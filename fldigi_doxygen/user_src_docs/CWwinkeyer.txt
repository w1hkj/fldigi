If you own a WinKeyer, WinKeyer USB, or compatible keying interface then
you may use that device with fldigi to key your transceiver.<br>

The transceiver must be in either CW or CW-reverse mode for the WinKeyer
to correctly key the transceiver.  If you are using rig control, then the
waterfall will correctly show the received CW in relation to the suppressed
carrier insertion point.  The waterfall scale will decrease from left to right
if the transceiver operates CW as LSB and increase from left to right if the
transceiver CW operates as USB (usually CW and CW-REV as on my IC-7200).<br>

The transceiver will either have a fixed or adjustable CW received pitch.  On
the IC-7200 this is a menu item named CW-PITCH.  I prefer listening to a 700 Hertz
CW signal and set my transceiver accordingly.  You must also set the fldigi
CW sweetspot to the same value to insure that QSY, DXcluster spotting and other RF/AF
functions to operate correctly in fldigi.<br>

Open the configuration dialog and click on the CW/WinKeyer item in the tree menu.

\section winkeyer_config_items Configuration Items
The fldigi configuration interface for the WinKeyer is similar to the one available
in the application flwkey.  It will probably not exactly match any Windows application
you may have received with the WinKeyer kit.<br>

You may elect to use the speed potentiometer on the WinKeyer hardware.  Check the "Use Pot"
control and changes to the WinKeyer speed will be annunciated to both the configuration tab
and the fldigi main dialog.<br>
<center>

</center>
If you do not use the potentiometer, then fldigi will use it's internal controls
which are described in the CW modem and CW modem configuration.
<br>
\subsection wk_keyer_mode Keyer Mode
WinKey supports Iambic A, B, Ultimatic, and Bug keying modes. In iambic 
mode WinKey makes both dits and dahs automatically based on which paddle 
you press. In bug mode WinKey makes the dits and you make the dahs. You 
also can use bug mode to operate in straight key mode or if you want to 
key through WinKey with a different keyer, simply set bug mode and use the 
dah input to key WinKey.  In either iambic mode, alternating dits and dahs 
are sent while both paddles are held closed. In mode B an extra alternate 
dit or dah is sent after both paddles are released.  In Ultimatic mode 
when both paddles are pressed the keyer will send a continuous stream of 
whichever paddle was last pressed.

\subsection wk_sidetone Sidetone
You can adjust the audible keying tone that the WinKeyer produces using the
Sidetone selector.  Turn the audio on and off using the "Tone ON" control

\subsection wk_hangtime Hang time
Hang Time works by holding PTT on between paddle presses.  The holding time
is call "hang time" and is measured in word space time.<br>
<ul>
<li>Wait 1.0 wordspace before ending paddle insertion</li>
<li>Wait 1.33 wordspace before ending paddle insertion</li>
<li>Wait 1.66 wordspace before ending paddle insertion</li>
<li>Wait 2.0 wordspace before ending paddle insertion</li>
</ul>

\subsection wk_output_pins Output Pins
The keyline can be connected and controlled from eithe "Key 1", "Key 2", or
both simultaneously.  Select the one that is appropriate for your installation.

\subsection wk_modes Mode Register Controls
WinKeyer maps various internal controls to a "mode register" in which the state
of the control is either on or off.  These are mapped to the fldigi "ModeReg"
controls:
<ul>
<li>Swap<br>
This is a nice feature to have when right and left handed ops want to share the same keyer.
Enable to reverse the sense of the left and right paddles.
</li>
<li>Auto Space<br>
Here is how autospace works: If you pause for more than one dit time 
between a dit or dah WinKey will interpret this as a letter-space and will 
not send the next dit or dah until full letter-space time has been met.
The normal letter-space is 3 dit spaces. WinKey has a paddle event memory 
so that you can enter dits or dahs during the inter-letter space and WinKey 
will send them as they were entered. With a little practice, autospace will 
help you to send near perfect Morse.  This only applies CW sent using the
paddles connected to the WinKeyer.
</li>
<li>CT space<br>
Winkey supports contest spacing which reduces the wordspace time by one dit. 
Instead of 7 dits per wordspace, Contest spacing selects six dits per wordspace.
</li>
<li>Paddle Dog<br>
Winkey has a paddle watchdog counter that will disable the key output after 
128 consecutive dits or dahs.  This is to guard against the paddles being 
accidentally keyed continuously. By default the paddle watchdog is on but 
it can be turned off by disabling this control.
</li>
<li>Cut 0/9<br>
Enable to force WinKeyer to send a T for 0 and N for 9.  Often used in contests
to shorten transmissions such as 599 to 5NN.
</li>
<li>Paddle echo<br>
When this control is set characters entered on the paddles will be echoed 
back to the host. From the host perspective paddle echo and serial echo 
are the same, in either case the letter sent in Morse by WinKey is echoed 
back to the host. The echo occurs after the letter has been completely sent.
This feature is not currently used by the fldigi / WinKeyer implementation.
</li>
<li>Serial echo<br>
Always enabled.
</li>
<li>Tone Keyer<br>
Normally WinKeyer uses PTT output. Sacrificing PTT functionality, 
the WinKeyer can be configured to output a square wave sidetone instead by using 
enabling the "Tone Keyer".
</li>
<li>Tone ON<br>
Enable the audible keying tone emanated by the WinKeyer hardware.
</li>
<li>PTT ON<br>
Enable the PTT lines.  Normally enabled, but you might want to disable if
you are simply practicing CW and do not want to key the transmitter.
</li>
</ul>
\subsection wk_wpm_settings WPM Settings
These controls allow the user to set up various internal WinKeyer variables.
<ul>
<li>Min WPM<br>
Sets the WPM for the minimum WinKeyer poteniometer position
</li>
<li>Rng WPM<br>
Sets the WPM range for the WinKeyer potentiometer
</li>
<li>Farnsworth<br>
Farnsworth spacing is useful for CW practice because it encourages you to 
learn characters by sound not individual dits and dahs. In WinKeyer, 
Farnsworth is implemented by sending letters at a fixed rate of nn
WPM regardless what the WPM sending rate is. Spacing between characters 
is determined by the sending rate. When the WPM rate is set above the 
Farnsworth WPM, Farnsworth is automatically disabled.
</li>
<li>Cmd WPM<br>
Sets the WPM used for sending commands to the WinKeyer using the paddles.
</li>
</ul>

\subsection wk_timing_settings Timing Settings
These control various aspects of the WinKeyer keyline output.
<ul>
<li>Ratio<br>
Allows WinKey to deviate from the standard 1:3 ratio of dit/dah.
</li>
<li>Weight<br>
This control allows a proportional amount to be either added or subtracted 
from the length of all dits and dahs sent. Note that weighting does not affect 
sending speed because any increase in keyed time is subtracted from spacing time. 
Reduction in weighting results in a thinner sounding keying while increased 
weighting results in a heavier sound. Since weighting tracks speed, a given
weighting will sound the same at all speeds.
</li>
<li>Comp<br>
Keying Compensation allows a fixed amount of time in milliseconds to be added 
to the length of all dits and dahs.<br>

QSK keying on modern transceivers can cause shortening of the dit and dah 
elements which is especially noticeable at high speeds. WinKeyer allows the 
length of the dit and dah elements to be increased uniformly to compensate for
this. The adjustments are made in units of one-millisecond steps. The maximum 
adjustment is 250 mSecs.<br>

Key compensation is very similar to Weighting in that any adjustment added 
to the dits and dahs is subtracted from the spacing so the speed is not changed. 
The difference between weighting and compensation is that compensation is 
independent of speed, so if 10 msec of key compensation is selected 
10 msec will be always be added regardless of speed. So be careful at 
high speeds and large values of key compensation, you may end up with 
no inter-element space.
</li>
<li>Lead-in, Tail<br>
WinKeyer provides a transmitter PTT output that can be used to switch a 
transmitter or linear amplifier over to transmit mode in advance of actual 
CW keying. You have control over the time delay between when PTT is
asserted and when CW keying will start, this is lead-in. You also have 
control over how long the transmitter will stay in transmit after keying has 
stopped; this is the tail delay.
</li>
<li>1st Ext<br>
WinKey addresses a problem often encountered when keying older transceivers 
that have a slow break-in response. Due to a slow receive to transmit 
changeover time, the first dit or dah of a letter sequence can be
chopped and reduced in length. Adding a fixed amount to the first element 
of a sequence can compensate for this.<br>

For example, an R would be sent with the first dit elongated but the 
subsequent dah-dit sent normally. The compensation amount is transceiver 
dependent and is generally independent of sending speed. Note though that 
this is usually only a noticeable problem at higher CW speeds >25 WPM.<br>

A challenge in this scheme is to determine when sending has stopped long 
enough to cause the transceiver to switch back to receive. If it has it’ll 
require a new first element correction on the next sequence. WinKeyer
uses the PTT tail timer to determine this, set the tail timer to roughly 
match the transmit to receive changeover time of the transceiver and things 
will work fine. It takes some trial and error to get it set up right
so make sure you preserve the value and load it as a defaults after reset.
</li>
<li>Sample<br>
Sets the number of samples per second that WinKeyer uses to read the WPM
potentiometer and the paddle states.
</li>
</ul>

\section wk_qsy_ops Dx Cluster QSY with Winkeyer

Set the fldigi configuration item for CW sweetspot to be the same as the transceiver's
CW PITCH setting.  On older transceivers this might be the same as the beat
frequency oscillator, BFO, setting.  The following should work correctly whether
controlling the transceiver using hamlib, rigcat, or flrig.

Select a dx station to track by clicking on the dx report line (see 
\ref dxcluster_interface_page).  If the dx station was reported as operating
at 7.0164 MHz but is actually at 7.0128 MHz; then the flrig and fldigi controls
will look like this if the transceiver's CW is an LSB mode:

and the waterfall will appear as

Center the waterfall tracking point over the actual signal and then press the 
fldigi QSY button.  The waterfall will change to
