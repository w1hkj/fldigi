\section logbook_dialog Logbook Dialog
You open the logbook by selecting from the Logbook menu; Logbook/View.  The
logbook title bar will show you which logbook you currently have open.
Fldigi can maintain an unlimited (except for disk space) number of logbooks.<br>

</center><br>

You can resize the dialog to suit your screen size and operating needs.
Fldigi will remember the placement and size for subsequent use.<br>

You can create new entries, update existing entries, and delete entries
using this dialog.  You can also search for an entry by callsign.  The browser
can be sorted by Date, Callsign, Frequency or Mode.  The sort can
be forward or backward with the most recent being the default selected
entry after each sort.  You execute the sort by clicking on the
column button at the top of the column to be sorted.  Each click
causes the sort to reverse.  I like to view my log with the most
recent at the top.  You might want to view it with the most recent on the
bottom.<br>

Recent changes to the support code has reduced the time and cpu load associated
with reading, writing, and updating the adif data file.  The following statistics
should give the user some idea as to the performance expectations.  These were
measured on a Linux Mint-17 32 bit OS; CPU: Intel Pentium 4 CPU @ 3.20 GHz;
solid state drive 250 GB.  Depending on OS version, Windows users should expect
to see larger times for read and sort.  The increase primarily due to the way
that the Windows OS handles disk buffering and it's multi-threading implementation.<br>

\section list_of_log_fields List of Log Fields
Fldigi maintains a large set of QSO logbook fields that will probably be
sufficient for casual operating, contesting and some certificate logging.  All
of the fields that are captured in the logbook are maintained in an ADIF
database that can be read by any logbook program that can read the ADIF text
format.
<br>

The complete set of logbook fields are:
<br>

  ADIF FIELD |   | USE
:----------- |:-:| :----------------------------------------------

OP_CALL      | * | Callsign of person logging the QSO
STA_CALL     | * | Callsign of transmitting station
MY_GRID      | * | Xmt station locator
MY_CITY      | * | Xmt station location
<br>

\* - These fields are either captured on the main dialog, computed from
internal values, or determined by configuration.
<br>

The data in the fldigi logbook can be exported to external text files;
ADIF, text, and CSV (comma separated value).   The ADIF can be
read by any ADIF compatible logbook program.  The text output is
suitable for use in a wordprocessor and for printing.  The CSV can
be read into many spreadsheet programs such as Excel, Open Office or
Gnumeric.
<br>

\section digital_mode_signal_reports Digital Modes Signal Reports

Fldigi does not enforce any rules on signal reporting.  It could very
well do so for many of the modes in which signal quality is inherently
measured as a part of the decoder.  Learning how to evaluate a
signal, to properly report it, and then help in correcting deficiencies
should be the goal of every amateur operator.  Please read further
on using both \ref rst_rsq_page "RST and RSQ signal reports".
<br>

\section capturing_qso_data Capturing QSO Data

Fldigi supports two QSO capture panels.  The first for casual QSO logging
<br>

\image html log-qso.png "QSO capture panel"
\image latex log-qso.png "QSO capture panel" width=6.5in
<br>

and the second for contest fields
<br>

\image html log-contest.png "Contest capture panel"
\image latex log-contest.png "Contest capture panel" width=6.5in
<br>

You might prefer a more minimal view of the logging fields.  You can select
to completely suppress the log panel or to use a single line view as in
either of these two:
<br>

\image html log-qso-min.png "Minimal QSO Capture Panel"
\image latex log-qso-min.png "Minimal QSO Capture Panel" width=6.5in
<br>

\image html log-contest-min.png "Minimal Contest Capture Panel"
\image latex log-contest-min.png "Minimal Contest Capture Panel" width=6.5in
<br>

These are selectable from the View menu:
<br>

\image html menu-view.png "View menu"
\image latex menu-view.png "View menu" width=1.5in
<br>

These three buttons are associated with logbook entries.
<br>

<ul>
	<li> The globe button provides access
	to \ref callsign_db_configuration_page "QRZ queries" </li>
	<li>The brush button clears all of the logging entries </li>
	<li>The save-into button saves the current logging entries into the
	logbook</li>
</ul>
<br>

\image html log-buttons.png "Log Buttons"
\image latex log-buttons.png "Log Butons" width=0.5in
<br>

The frequency, Off (time off), and \#Out are filled by the program. All
the others can be populated by manual keyboard entry or by
selection from the Rx panel.  The time off, Off, is continuously
update with the current GMT.  The time on, On, will be filled in
when the Call is updated, but can be modified later by the operator.
<br>

A right click on the Rx panel brings up a context sensitive menu that will
reflect which of the two QSO capture views you have open.
<br>


\image html menu-rx-popup-long.png "Normal Menu"
\image latex menu-rx-popup-long.png "Normal Menu" width=1.0in
<br>

\image html menu-rx-popup-contest-short.png "Contest Menu"
\image latex menu-rx-popup-contest-short.png "Contest Menu" width=1.0in
<br>

If you highlight text in the Rx pane then the menu selection will operate
on that text.  If you simply point to a word of text and right
click then the menu selection will operate on the single word.
<br>

Certain fields may also be populated with automatic parsing, Call, Name, QTH
and Loc.   You point to the Rx pane word and then either
double-left-click or hold a shift key down and left click.  The
program will attempt to parse the word as a regular expression to
populate the Call, Name, QTH, and Loc fields in that order.  It
may place some non standard calls into the Loc field if they qualify as
a proper Maidenhead Grid Square, such as MM55CQ.  That may be a
special event station, but it also looks like a grid square locator
value.  You need to decide when that occurs and use the pop up
menu for those special cases.  The first non-Call non-Loc word
will fill the Name field and subsequent qualify words will go into the
QTH field.
<br>

A highlighted section of text, can always be copied
to the clipboard for subsequent pasting elsewhere.  The Copy menu
item will be active when text in the Rx pane has been highlighted. That
text can also be saved to a file.  Use the \"Save as...\" menu item for that
purpose.  All data fields in fldigi share a common set of keyboard
shortcuts.  Linux users will recognize these as familiar Emacs
shortcuts.  There is also a small popup menu that can be opened for each
field by right clicking the contents with the mouse:
<br>

\image html menu-popup-edit-field.png "Menu Popup Edit Field"
\image latex menu-popup-edit-field.png "Menu Popup Edit Field" width=1.6in
<br>

Highlighted text will be overwritten when a paste is selected.  Otherwise the
clipboard will be pasted at the current cursor position.
<br>

The two most extreme right fields in the casual and contest views require some
explanation.  The topmost field in a multi-line edit control and it's contents
are for notes or comments.  When a remote database query is made this control
will be populated with the street address of the queried call sign (if available).
The small button on the lower line of controls is used to toggle the usage of
the entry control to it's right.  That entry control is "Country" when the button
face shows 'C', and "County" when the button face shows 'c'.  These two controls
provide a convenience for county hunters.
<br>

You can query on-line and local CD based data base systems for data
regarding a Call.  Set up your query using
the \ref callsign_db_configuration_page "Callsign DB configuration tab".
You make the query by either clicking on the globe button, or
selecing "Look up call" from the menu.  The latter will also move
the call to the Call field and make the query.
<br>

If you have previously worked a station the logbook will be searched for the
most recent qso and fill the Name, Qth and other fields from the logbook. If
the logbook dialog is open that last QSO will be selected for viewing in the
logbook.
<br>


Fldigi's logbook is primarily a capture function.  You can export your 
data for use with an external database or for uploading to LOTW or eQSL.
Data from those sources can also be used for importing into the logbook.
<br>

LoTW: \ref lotw_interface_page  "LoTW configuration and use"

Fldigi can connect to 3rd party Logbook and Contest Log programs such as
\ref n3fjp_logs_page "N3FJP ACL and the N3FJP contest programs".  On OS X, it can automatically export
data to the MacLogger program.

Exporting logbook data: \ref exporting_logbook_data "Log Exports".
