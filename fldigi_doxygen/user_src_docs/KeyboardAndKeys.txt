The transmit buffer for fldigi is type ahead which means that you
can be typing text while the program is sending an earlier part of your
transmitted message.

Newly entered text appears in black and text which has been transmitted
is changed to red.  You can backspace into the red area. When you do and
the modem in use supports the BS character it will be sent to the receiving
station.  If you monitor PSK and MFSK signals you will often find operators
backspacing over previously sent text.  It's probably just as easy to just
send XXX and retype that part of the message, but we have gotten used to
word processors, email, etc. that allow us to send perfect (right) text, so
we expect our digital modems to do the same.  Let's see, what was that
prosign often used in CW for oooops.
<br>

All of the alpha numeric keys perform as you would expect, entering
text into the transmit buffer.  There is one very important
exception:
<br>

The caret "^" symbol, which fldigi uses as a meta character.  The ^ is 
used in the macro expansion routine and also used by the transmit buffer 
evaluator.  A ^r puts fldigi into receive mode.  So you can enter the ^r 
(caret followed by the r) at the end of your transmit buffer and when 
the sent character cursor (red chars) gets to that point the program will 
clear the text and return to the receive mode.
<br>

Other useful meta combinations:
<ul>
<li>^l ^L - save the log entry when meta combination parsed</li>
<li>^p ^P - pause transmission at this point in transmit text</li>
<li>^r ^R - return to receive clear all transmit text</li>
</ul>
<br>

You can load the transmit buffer with any ASCII Text file of your
choice.  Merely right click in the buffer window and select from
the pop-up menu.  You can also short cut to the ^r from
this popup.
<br>

Many ops (including me) do not like to be tied to a mouse.  The
fldigi text widget supports some short cuts to make your life easier:
<br>

<ul>
    <li>Pause/Break - a transmit / receive - pause button. </li>
    <ul>
        <li>if you are in the receive mode and press the Pause/Break key the
        program will switch to the transmit mode.  It will begin transmitting
        characters at the next point in the transmit buffer following the red
        (previously sent text).  If the buffer only contains unsent text,
        then it will begin at the first character in the buffer.  If the
        buffer is empty, the program will switch to transmit mode and
        depending on the mode of operation will send idle characters or
        nothing at all until characters are entered into the buffer.</li>

       <li>if you are in the transmit mode and press the Pause/Break key
       the program will switch to the receive mode.  There may be a slight
       delay for some modes like MFSK, PSK and others that require you to
       send a postamble at the end of a transmission.  The transmit text
       buffer stays intact, ready for the Pause/Break key to return you to
       the transmit mode.</li>

       <li>Think of the Pause/Break key as a software break-in capability.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Esc - </li>
  <ul>
      <li>Abort transmission. - immediately returns the program to receive,
      sending the required postamble for those modes requiring it. The
      transmit buffer is cleared of all text.</li>

      <li>Triple press on Esc - terminates the current transmission without
      sending a postamble - The PANIC button.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Ctrl-R will append the ^r (return to receive) at the end of the
  current text buffer.</li>

  <li>Ctrl-T will start transmitting if there is text in the transmit
  text window.</li>

  <li>Alt/Meta-R will perform the same function as the Pause/Break key</li>

  <li>Tab moves the text insert cursor to the end of the transmitted text 
  (which also pauses tx).   Characters entered from the keyboard will be 
  transmitted as entered until the tx text entry point is returned to the 
  end of the tx buffer.  A tab press at that position returns the cursor 
  to the end of the text buffer. Transmitted text and text pending transmit 
  are color coded red and black respectively (default colors):
  
  <center>
  \image html TxCursor.png "Tx Cursor Position"
  \image latex TxCursor.png "Tx Cursor Position" width=2.5in
  </center>
  
  Be aware that fldigi will NEVER transmit past the text insert cursor!  You
  may be caught by that behavior if you are modifying the buffer and transmitting
  at the same time.  Or you may have accidentally mouse clicked in the middle of 
  the Tx text with the result that fldigi suddenly stops transmitting.  In either
  case the Tab key will return the text insert cursor to the end of the tx buffer.
  
  CW operation is slightly different, see the help for \ref cw_page .</li>

  <li>Extended UTF-8 characters can be entered into all text entry controls
  using Ctrl + three digits.  These characters can also be entered using
  the right-click pop-up menu item \"Spec Char \".  The extended character 
  transmitted by fldigi will actually be a 2 byte UTF-8 string.
  
  see \ref xchar_page "Extended Characters"

\section function_keys Function Keys

Keys F1 through F12 are used to invoke the macro F1 - F12.  You
can also just click on the macro key button associated with that
function key.  There are 4 sets of 12 macros. If you press the numbered
button on the macro button bar the next set of macros are referenced by
the F1 - F12.   A right click on the numbered button provides a reverse
rotation through the 4 sets of macro keys.  The respective macro set can be
made available by pressing the Alt-1, Alt-2, Alt-3 or Alt-4 key
combination.  Note that this is not Alt-F1 etc.
