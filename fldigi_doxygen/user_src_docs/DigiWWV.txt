Some analog transmissions such as FAX, MFSK images, and Thor images will
exhibit a slant in the received image if the sound card clock (sample rate)
is not identical at both the transmitter and receiver.  The best way to
insure that they are identical is to calibrate both to an external frequency
and time standard.  Operators in the North American region can use the WWV and/or
WWVH standard time transmissions for this purpose.  European and Asian users
should be able to use the German DCF-77 or Russian RMW time transmissions.<br>

The WWV mode is used to measure the offset of the sound card oscillator.
It does this by comparing the sound card sample rate with 
the clock tick signal that is transmitted by WWV and WWVH.<br>

The sampling rate for the sound card should be set to "native".  The sound card
samples the signal and returns a block of samples in blocks of 512.  This block
sampling is what sets the basic timing mechanism for the thread that
reads the sound card.  Most modern soundcards will use 44100 or 48000 as the native smampling rate.
The sampled signal is filtered and reduced to a sample
rate of 1000 by a process called decimiation in time.  The resulting signal is then power detected and
low pass filtered with a filter called a moving average filter. The moving
average is very good at detecting the edge of a pulse such as the 1 second
tick transmitted by WWV.<br>

This decoded/filtered signal is then displayed in a manner very
similar to a FAX signal.  Each scan line represents the received signal
over a 1 second interval.  The bright white line is the time tick.  You can
see a very slight slope from left to right as the signal goes from top to
bottom of the display.<br>

Open the configure dialog box to the "SndCrd" tab.  You are going
to be adjusting the "Rx PPM" while you observe the effect of this
control on the slope of the time tick line.<br>

Tune in WWV or WWVH on 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 or 15.0 MHz in the AM mode. This
seems to give the best signal view.  Select the WWV modem.  Open the scope dialog
from the menu "View / Floating scope".  Adjust the scope dialogs width and height
to a 1:3 or greater ratio.  Signal data will begin to accumulate in the digiscope display.<br>

When you can clearly see the bright tick line, move the cursor to the bottom of the line and left
click at that position.  That will resync the digiscope display and put the
ensuing tick marks at the center line red graticule. Then right click anywhere 
in the digiscope display.  That changes the zoom level to show more signal
detail and the slope of the time tick line will be more discernable. The zoom level 
increases by a factor of 5.  Right clicking again restores the original zoom level.
I recommend making the adjustments to the Rx PPM control in the x5 zoom level.<br>

If the slope of the time tick line is positive you will need to apply a
negative value to the Rx PPM.  If it is negative then a
positive correction is needed.<br>

Start with a correction of 0 ppm and observe the slope.  Try a
value of 1000 ppm and observe the slope.  Again, try a -1000 ppm
correction and observe the slope.  The following are some observations
made on 10 MHz WWV, DCF-77 and RWM under less than ideal conditions.<br>

You can see that my sound card requires a positive correction since the
slope is negative with a 0 ppm entry.  The required correction of
+120 ppm was determined by guessing the needed correction to be close
to 1/10 of the -1000 ppm slope and then adjusting for a steady track
along the red graticule.  The DCF-77 images were provided by
Walter, DL8FCL.  The RWM images were provided by Andy G3TDJ.
<br>

You can left click on the tick line anytime you want to recenter the
signal.  That will aid in making your visual observation.
<br>

When you are finished, the Rx PPM entry is the correct one for
your sound card.  Save the configuration for future fldigi use.
