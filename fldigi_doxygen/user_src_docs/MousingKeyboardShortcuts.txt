Fldigi has a bewildering number of keyboard and mouse shortcuts, some
of which may help make your particular style of operation more
efficient.  You do not need to know them all to make effective use
of the program!
<br>

\section main_window Main window
<br>

\subsection text_input_fields Text input fields
<br>

Most text fields use a combination of CUA (PC) and Unix-style
keybindings.  Text can be marked, copied, pasted, saved to a file
as well as transfer to other main panel controls.  A right click
on any text control will open a context sensitive menu for that
particular control.  A full list can be found on the
<a href="http://www.fltk.org/doc-1.1/Fl_Input.html">FLTK web site</a>
<br>

The received/transmitted text widgets use CUA key bindings with some
modifications:

\subsubsection rx_text RX text

This widget is read-only and ignores shortcuts that would modify its contents.
<br>

\subsubsection tx_text TX text

The text that has already been sent is protected, but can be deleted one
character at a time with the Backspace key.  Right clicking on the Tx text
panel opens the following popup menu:
<br>

<br>

\image html menu-tx-popup2.png "Fldigi Transmitting"
\image latex menu-tx-popup2.png "Fldigi Transmitting" width=1.0in
<br>

<ul>
	<li>Transmit<br> put the program into the transmit operation</li><br>
	<li>Receive<br>during a transmit or tune, end the transmit and restore
	receive operation</li><br>
	<li>Abort<br>during a transmit, receive without waiting for the modem to
	finish sending</li><br>
	<li>Send image<br>for MFSK only, send an image using MFSKpic mode</li><br>
	<li>Clear<br>clear all of the text</li><br>
	<li>Cut<br>delete the marked text (by left click drag over text)</li><br>
	<li>Copy<br>copy the marked text to the clipboard</li><br>
	<li>Paste<br>the clipboard text to the current text insertion point</li><br>
	<li>Insert file<br>select a file from file browser to insert in text at
	insertion point</li><br>
	<li>Word wrap<br>turn word wrap on/off</li><br>
</ul>

The Tx panel is fully drag and drop aware.  That means you can add a
file to the transmit text by simply opening up a file manager
(different for different OS and choice of desktop).  Select the
file from the manager and then drag and drop it onto the Tx panel. The mouse
pointer will move the cursor insert point for the drop.
<br>

A number of additional shortcuts can be found in the
\ref keyboard_operation_page "Keyboard Operation" section.


\subsection waterfall_display Waterfall display
<br>

Most of fldigi's unusual shortcuts are specific to this widget.
<br>


\subsubsection waterfall_display_keyboard Waterfall display - Keyboard

<ul>
<li>Shift Left/Right - move the b/w marker by 1 Hz</li>
<li>Ctrl  Left/Right - move the b/w marker by 10 Hz</li>
</ul>

	release</li>
	<li>Middle click - toggle AFC</li>
	<li>Ctrl-Left click - replay audio history at b/w marker position</li>
	<li>Ctrl-Right click - replay at cursor frequency and return on
	button release</li>
	<li>Ctrl-Middle click copy the frequency under the cursor to
	the currently selected (or first) channel in the PSK viewer, and
	select the next channel</li>
	<li>Shift-Left click/drag  same as unmodified left click; no signal
	search</li>
	<li>Shift-Right click/drag  likewise, with a return to the previous
	frequency when the button is released, no signal search</li>
	<li>Shift-mouse wheel - move the squelch slider</li>
	<li>Scroll wheel usage is dependent upon the
	configuration (see \ref ui_configuration_waterfall_controls_page "ConfigWaterfall")</li>
	<ul>
		<li>None - no mouse wheel activity in waterfall panel</li>
		<li>AFC range or BW - adjust the AFC range/BW up/down</li>
		<li>Squelch level - adjust the squelch level up/down</li>
		<li>Modem carrier - adjust the audio tracking point +/- Hz increments</li>
		<li>Modem - select modem type from a full rotary of available modems</li>

	</ul>
    <li>Ctrl-Alt-Left click on the mouse when the mouse pointer is

    such as the FT-950, will set the transceiver manual notch frequency to
    the frequency under the mouse cursor.  Repeat the Ctrl-Alt-Left click
    to disengage the notch.  Disengagement is not dependent on where the
    cursor is on the waterfall, just that it be in the waterfall.</li>
