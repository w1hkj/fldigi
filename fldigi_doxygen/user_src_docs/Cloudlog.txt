\section Cloudlog_intro Introduction

This logbook interface applies to users who want fldigi to automatically
transfer the logged QSOs to a Cloudlog instance via the Cloudlog REST API.
More information and documentation regarding Cloudlog can be found at
https://www.magicbug.co.uk/cloudlog/.

\section Cloudlog_setup Cloudlog Configuration

The configuration for Cloudlog requires the URL, an API key and a Station
Location number to log to. The API key can be created within Cloudlog by
selecting "API Keys" within the user account menu. Be sure to generate a
read % write key. The top of the page also shows the API URL. The number
of the station location can be found on the "Station Locations" page
from the user menu. It is shown as ID for every location listed.

These three values have to be configured in the Cloudlog section in the
fldigi configuration under Logging - Cloudlog.
<br>

There is a test button that allows for testing the functionality of the
configured Cloudlog instance and its API key. If the key is valid and
allows write access the button will turn green after pressing it. If it
turns red either the API key or the URL is wrong. For a basic test there
also is a test function within Cloudlog to test API keys.

\section Cloudlog_usage Cloudlog Usage

If Cloudlog is enabled in the configuration of fldigi all QSO data will
automatically be transmitted to Cloudlog via its REST API if the log QSO
button is pressed. All other logging mechanism are not affected by these
settings
