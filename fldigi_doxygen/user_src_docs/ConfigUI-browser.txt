Signals can be viewed in a multi-channel context for the following modes:
<ul>
<li>CW</li>
<li>PSK-31, PSK-63, PSK-63F, PSK-125, PSK-250, PSK-250, PSK-500</li>
<li>PSK-125R, PSK-250R, PSK-500R</li>
<li>QPSK-31, QPSK-63, QPSK-125, QPSK-250, QPSK-500</li>
<li>RTTY</li>
</ul>
The multi-channel display is either a separate dialog or an embedded resizable
panel.

1) select the number of 100 Hz channels you want visible<br>
2) select the start frequency for the browser (your transceiver may
not rx signals below this value)<br>
3) select the inactivity timeout for the browser. After this
number of seconds the channel will be cleared and prepared for the next
detection cycle.<br>
4) select what kind of label annotation you want on each line<br>
5) select the font and font size to be used in the browser<br>
6) You can enter any text you want to search for in the
<i>Seek Regular Expression</i> widget. This text can be a simple text
snippet such as "CQ" or any regular expression. When the regex is
satisfied in a channel the text color for that channel is changed to
red. With a regex you can specify a more generic pattern, which means
that you can match more things and your search is somewhat noise tolerant.
Here is an example for a CQ from a US station (should match most
callsigns):
<br>

\verbatim
>cq.+[aknw][a-z]?[0-9][a-pr-z][a-z]{1,2}
\endverbatim
<br>

This says "cq followed by at least one character, followed by one A,
K, N, or W, followed by an optional letter, followed by a digit,
followed by a letter that is not q, followed by one or two letters".
The search is case-insensitive.
<br>

All plain text is a valid regular expression, unless you really had
been looking for these metacharacters:
<br>

\verbatim
.[{()\*+?|^$
\endverbatim
<br>

These will have to be escaped with a backslash.<br>

7) select whether you want a marquee type of continuous scrolling, or simply
 clear the line when it is filled.<br>
8) select whether you want the lowest frequency at the bottom (checked) or
 the top of browser panel<br>
9) select whether you want the audio stream history buffer to be played back
 when you select an active channel. The first-in first-out audio
 history represents the previous 2 minutes of received audio.<br>
10) Both the background and slider highlight colors can be selected for the
signal browser detection level control. The default colors are shown
in these images.<br>
11) You can set the 2 levels of text hi-lighting that is used in the browser
lines<br>

<ul>
<li>HiLite 1 - Text color when the regular expression evaluator finds the
target text</li>
<li>HiLite 2 - Text color when your call sign appears in that receive
channel</li>
</ul>
12) You can set the background colors for the odd/even lines and the line selection color<br>
