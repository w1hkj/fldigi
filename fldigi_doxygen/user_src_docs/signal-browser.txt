Signals can be viewed in a multi-channel context for the following modes:
<ul>
<li>CW</li>
<li>PSK-31, PSK-63, PSK-63F, PSK-125, PSK-250, PSK-250, PSK-500</li>
<li>PSK-125R, PSK-250R, PSK-500R</li>
<li>QPSK-31, QPSK-63, QPSK-125, QPSK-250, QPSK-500</li>
<li>RTTY</li>
</ul>
You can open an embedded or a separate dialog to access the
browser.  These browsers can help to locate a signal of interest
on a busy band.  The browsers can be visible at any time, but are only
active when fldigi is in one of the PSK or RTTY modes.  Open the external
by clicking on the <b>View/Signal browser</b> menu item.

It looks like this:

<br>

Toggle the visibility of the embedded viewer by selecting the <b>
View/Hide Channels</b> on the same menu list.  Your main fldigi screen
then opens a browser panel on the left side of the Tx/Rx panel(s).  Both
browsers can be viewed and used simultaneously.  When you click on a valid
waterfall signal the browser will highlight the appropriate channel (if
it is also tracking that signal).

<br>

This panel can be resized horizontally by dragging the interface between the
browser and the Rx panel to the left and right.  You can drag all the way to
the left to close the panel (or use the menu button).  The drag to the right
is limited to prevent sizing the Rx/Tx panels below their allowable limits.
<br>

The browser can decode up to 30 simultaneous signals.  As each signal is
acquired within a 100 Hz channel width it is printed on the associated
line.  The user can elect to have each line annotated with
<br>
<br>
a channel number, <br>
the waterfall audio frequency, <br>
the transceiver HF frequency + waterfall, or<br>
no annotation.<br>
<br>
Left click on a line of received text to move the waterfall frequency
and Rx panel tracking to that signal.  The contents of the line of
text is transferred to the Rx text widget, and the main signal processing loop
begins to track and decode that signal.  Right click on a line of received
text and that line is cleared and the channel reset for a new
detection.  You may have to do this occasionally if the detector
for that channel has locked on to a sideband of a PSK signal.
This is most likely to occur when the received signal as a marginal or
bad IMD.  Use the <b>Clear</b> button to clear and reset all of the
channels.  Channel signal detection and processing should restart immediately.<br>
<br>
The slider control is a squelch for the channel detectors.  Move it to the left until
the decoders are displaying noise, then to the right to squelch the noise.
