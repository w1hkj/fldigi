This software would not have been possible without the contribution of many
programmers who have given their best to the open source community.  The
application is built upon the foundation of the Fast Light Tool
Kit (http://www.fltk.org), a wonderfully fast and efficient graphical user
interface design library.  Many have asked what the Fast Light means.  There
are probably as many answers as there are programmers using the toolkit. I
prefer to think of it as lightning fast and light on the code size.  Take a
look at the size of the executable for fldigi and then compare it with
similar applications.  I think you will be surprised by how small it is for
what it does.

The active current development team consists of:

Several authors have placed their digital modem code and signal
processing code in the public domain and their source was either an
inspiration or in some cases formed the backbone of the code used
in <i>Fldigi</i>.
<br>

<ul>
	<li>AE4JY - WinPsk - a windows application </li>
	<li>Tomi Manninen, OH2BNS - gmfsk - a great digital modem program for Linux</li>
	<li>Hamish Moffatt, VK3SB - dominoEX code originally for gmfsk</li>
	<li>Dr. Steven W. Smith - author of "Digital Signal Processing", who
	has kindly placed an entire book on digital signal processing on the
	internet.  (http://www.dspguide.com)</li>
</ul>
<br>

If you make a side-by-side comparison between gmfsk and fldigi source code
you will see that they follow the same general structure.  The primary
difference is that gmfsk is written in the C language and uses the gnome/gtk
libraries for the user interface.  <i>Fldigi</i> is a C++ application that
uses the Fast Light Tool Kit (Fltk) gui library.  The design
of <i>Fldigi</i> puts emphasis on separating the user interface from the
sound card and transceiver input/output operations. Nearly all modern
digital modem programs use a programming paradigm called "threads."  Threads
are light weight processes that share the same memory space, but each has
its own stack.  The use of threads makes the program look and feel
responsive to the user while a lot of code is being executed in the
background.
<br>

Many of the modem source code files are C to C++ rewrites from the
gmfsk application.  They say that copying is the best form of
flattery and gmfsk simply had the best explanations and the easiest
source code to read and understand.  The author had also spent
several months creating improvements and fixing bugs in the original
gmfsk application.  That exercise was the impetus to create <i>Fldigi</i>.
<br>

The Fast Fourier Transform used by <em>Fldigi</em> is a rewrite of John Green's
public domain FFT code (<a href="http://download.cnet.com/FFT-for-RISC/3000-2070_4-10003778.html">FFT for RISC for MAC</a>).
The rewrite is in C++ and is implemented as a C++ template.
Some of the signal processing algorithms used in <i>Fldigi</i>
are from Dr. Smith's book.  His on-line publication is sufficient
to allow you to become fluent in FFT analysis and the creation of
digital filters.  I printed the relevant pdf files and then
purchased the hard bound copy.  Improvements to the original gmfsk
signal processing algorithms can all be attributed to this excellent
source.
<br>

And last but certainly not least, I must thank the crew who perform
alpha testing and on-line support of the application.  These are stalwart amateurs who
risk their operating system and radio equipment in testing, testing and
more testing.  Their only reward is in being able to influence the
design of the application and the fun of seeing it work and the bugs
disappear.  Thank you to:

The test team is representative of users on Windows, Linux, Free
BSD and OS X operating systems.  They have varying interests from
very slow speed CW to high speed keyboard full break-in CW, from RTTY
contesters to PSK rag chewers.  They have insisted that
fldigi perform well under all of those operations.  I have been
amazed by the global distribution of the testing team.  It is easy
to think that the internet will be the death of amateur radio.  On
the contrary it opens up so many additional ways for us to be
cooperative.
