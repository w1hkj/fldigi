fldigi can connect to and display data from DX cluster servers.  The three
most common server types are AR-Cluster, CC-Cluster, and DX Spider.  Open the
dxcluster dialog from the View menu:

\section s_logon Logging on to remote host
Enter the DX HOST hostname/IP, the Port and your Login call.  Then check
the "Connect" control.  The "Connected" label will be visible only after
the remote host connection has been been made.  The above dialog shows the
4 hosts that I routinely use.
<ul>
<li>k4zr.no-ip.org, a DX Spider server</li>
<li>dxc.wb3ffv.us, a DX Spider server</li>
<li>nk7z-cluster.ddns.net, an AR Cluster server</li>
<li>dxspots.com, a CC Cluster server</li>
</ul>
Immediately after checking the "Connect" control the dxcluster dialog should
change to the "TelNet stream" tab.  This tab displays the raw telnet data
stream, shown here for the three server types:

\subsection s_dxc_config_hosts Managing Hosts
You can maintain a list of remote hosts to which you can reliably connect and
which provide good information relative to your QRA (Maidenhead locator).  The
following refers to the Config tab on the dxcluster dialog as shown above.
<ul>
<li>Add the current host to the list using the "Add" button.</li>
<li>Highlight an entry and press the "Select" button to transfer the elements
to the connect controls.</li>
<li>Highlight an entry and press the "Delete" button to delete an entry.</li>
<li>Use the menu item "Configure / Save Config" to save the modified list.
It will be restored the next time fldigi is executed.</li>
</ul>
Press the "Servers" button if you are unfamiliar with the telnet address and 
port number of a convenient dxcluster server.  fldigi will open up a local
html document with a list of recently verified servers:
<center>
\image html dxc_servers.png ""
\image latex dxc_servers.png "" width=8.0in
</center>
\subsection s_dxc_config_init_cmds Initial Host Commands
Most cluster servers will save your setup commands from a previous telnet
session.  You can also store those commands in the text editing control,
"Cluster Server Setup Cmds."
<br>

You can save and reload any number of command sequences.  Each is saved in a plain text
file in the fldigi files subfolder "Scripts".  The default extension for the dxcluster
scripts is "dxc".  Be sure you add the extension to your saved files.
It will not be added if you do not with the result that file may not be
visible when you try to load it.
<br>

Send the script to the remote server using the "Send" button.  The transmission and
response will be available for viewing on the "TelNet stream" tab.
\subsection s_dxc_config_macros Command Macros
Configure each of the 8 command macro buttons.  The m1...m8 controls are
the button label and the corresponding multi-line text control are the
associated server commands.
<br>
DX cluster command help can be viewed for each of the 3 server types.  
Press the corresponding help button:

\image latex dxc_cc_help.png "" width=7.0in
<br>
\image html dx_spider_help.png ""
\image latex dx_spider_help.png "" width=7.0in
</center>
\subsection s_cluster_colors DX cluster color scheme
You can change the text colors, and text fonts from the main fldigi configuration
dialog:
<center>
\image html dxc_font_color_config.png ""
\image latex dxc_font_color_config.png "" width=5.0in
</center>
\subsection s_auto_spotting  Spot when logged
Enable the "Spot when logged" check box if you want to create the spot report
whenever you log a contact from the fldigi main dialog.  You will still have
to review the spot report and submit it with the Submit button.
\subsection s_auto_connect  Auto Connect to Host
Enable the "Auto Connect" if you want to connect to the host when starting
fldigi.
\section s_dxc_stream TelNet stream
<center>
\image html dxc_dx_logon.png ""
\image latex dxc_dx_logon.png "" width=7.0in
</center>
The raw data to and from the cluster server is shown on the TelNet stream tab.
Sent data is in red and received data is in black.  The image shows the
automatic log on activity between my station and the K4ZR DXSpider cluster
server.  Those 4 lines are created based on your fldigi user configuration.
<br>

The TelNet stream text display is context sensitive to the right mouse button.
You can copy marked text or delete the display contents using the right mouse
button.
<br>

You can send individual commands to the remote host using the "Cmd:" control.
Enter the command, for example: "SHow/FILTER", or "SH/FILTER".  Then press the
"Submit" button.  The command string will be sent to the remote server and you
can view the results on the "TelNet stream" tab.
<br>

During a logon to the remote host fldigi will send some default commands depending
on the host type.  If the remote host is either an CC-Cluster or DX Spider host then
fldigi will send this sequence:
\verbatim
     set/page 0
     set/name [user name]
     set/qth [user qth]
     set/qra [user locator]
\endverbatim
Where the [] values are those entered on the main "User" configuration tab.
<br>

Sending prepared (macro) commands or dx spot reports to the remote server is
a two step process. Pressing any of the 4 macro buttons will transfer the macro string to the
Cmd: control.  You can modify the command string before pressing the Submit
button.
\subsection s_dxc_spotting Submitting a spot
You generate a spot report using the Spot button on the TelNet stream tab.
Fldigi will generate a spot report that tries to provide the cluster with
some mode details.  For example:
\verbatim
dx 3512.4 K2LBM RTTY [85]       mode is RTTY, Mark frequency @ 3512.485
dx 3581.1 K2LBM MFSK16 [50]     mode is MFSK16, center frequency @ 3581.150
dx 3580.8 K2LBM OLIVIA [00]     mode is OLIVIA (8-500), center frequency @ 3580.800
\endverbatim
Unfortunately, the ADIF mode specifier does not provide details reqarding mode
characteristics.  The [0..99] values in the notes field denote the additional
Hertz and tens-of-Hertz needed to specifiy the frequency to the nearest Hertz
rather than rounded as is usually reported in the cluster spot report.  This
field is only added to the report if the "Report [0..99 Hz]" control is
enabled on the dxcluster configure tab.
<br>

Pressing either of the SPOT buttons only adds the spot report to the Cmd: control.  You
can then modify the spot report before actually submitting the report using
the Submit button.

\section s_dxcluster_reports DX cluster reports
fldigi parses the received data stream and displays each dx spot in a tabular form on
the "DX Reports" tab:
<center>
\image html dxc_reports.png ""
\image latex dxc_reports.png "" width=7.0in
</center>
Left clicking on a spotted report line will transfer the frequency and mode to fldigi's
operating parameters.  The mode change is contingent on the mode being reported by the
spotter and included in the 'Notes' block.
<br>

You can elect to view the reports with the most recent on either the top or
the bottom of the list.

\subsection s_dxc_qsy_logic DX Cluster QSY logic
A cluster spot report line has this format:
\verbatim
-SPOTTER---<-FREQ--><--DX STA---><----------NOTES--------------><-UTC><LOC--
KB8O       14240.0  D66D         up 10 59 Ohio                  2059Z EN81
\endverbatim
fldigi will change mode if and only if the NOTES block contains a valid ADIF
mode specifier, i.e. CW, PSK31, QPSK63, RTTY, etc.<br>

The QSY logic does not make any assumptions regarding band, sub band in
determining the RF carrier and AF injection frequency.<br>

If the fldigi mode is SSB (available on the mode menu), then the QSY is
to the FREQ value with no change in the WF tracking frequency.<br>

Otherwise the existing mode or the mode detected in the NOTES is used
to determine the QSY values:
\verbatim
CW:   QSY is based on the CW sweet spot
RTTY: QSY is based on the RTTY sweet spot
PSK:  QSY is based on the PSK sweet spot
DIGI: QSY is based on the PSK sweet spot
\endverbatim
Most DX reports do not include a mode usage.  Ergo it is up to the user to
know what mode he or she is interested in.  Are you spotting SSB, then change
the fldigi mode to SSB.  Are you interested in CW?  Then change the mode to
CW.  This is really a KISS approach that is constrained by the very limited
amount of data contained in the DX spot report.
\section s_cluster_help On Line Cluster Help
The Help tab provides a convenient access to help obtained directly from the dxcluster
server.  It is the equivalent of using the HELP command from the Cmd: control.  The
difference is that the server reply is parsed and presented in a separate text viewer.
