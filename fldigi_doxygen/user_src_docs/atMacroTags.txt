The following macro tags will be parsed and qued for action after fldigi returns
to the receive mode, i.e. after the \<RX\> tag (^r) is executed.
<br>

 Tag                         | Description
:--------------------------: | :-----------------
\<\@MODEM: , ... \>          | Change to specified modem with parameters
\<\@RIGCAT:hex hex:retnbr\>  | RigCAT user commands
\<\@RIGCAT:"string":retnbr\> | hex hex ... are sequential hexadecimal values <br> string is Ascii char sequence retnbr  <br> is number of bytes in xcvr response ':retnbr'  <br> is optional; retnbr set to 0 if missing
\<\@GOHOME\>                 | return waterfall cursor to sweet spot
\<\@GOFREQ:NNNN\>            | move waterfall cursor to freq NNNN Hz
\<\@RIGMODE:mode\>           | send CAT command to transceiver to change to a valid mode
\<\@FILWID:width\>           | send CAT command to transceiver to change to a valid filter <br> width example to QSY to sweetspot (center of bandpass filter) and select <br> narrow filter
\<\@TXRSID:on\|off\|t\>      | transmit RSID on, off, toggle
\<\@PUSH:m|f\>               | Push (save) current mode(m), freq(f) for later retrieval
\<\@PUSH\>                   | Push both mode and freq for later retrieval
\<\@POP\>                    | Pop (restore) pushed mode and/or freq
<br>

Note that each of these tags is identical to their immediate mode
counterparts.  The exception is the addition of the \@ symbol following the
leading '\<'.  The use of these tags is best explained by example.
