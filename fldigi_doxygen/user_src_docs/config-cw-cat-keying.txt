\page cw_cat_keying  CW CAT Keying Configuration

fldigi supports CW keying using CAT commands to transceivers which support that method.  The
CAT connection may be either using RigCAT or flrig.
<br>
fldigi must be in the CW mode, and the transceiver set to CW mode for the keyline
to be active.  If available, the transceiver should be configured for either semi or full break-in.

The CW CAT-keying may require compensation for timing.  This is principally dependent
on the pc architecture, and operating system, and the effect is to lengthen the time between
characters.  The calibrate button
is used to measure the timing inaccuracy.  The measurement is made by sending a sequence 
of "PARIS " strings at the current CW WPM setting for 1 minute.  The actual time to transmit is
measured and compared to the ideal timing.  Be aware that this 
may transmit the characters.  Use low power or a dummy load for the test.  If needed, 
the computed compensation value will be entered in the Comp control.  You may also
manually enter or change this value.  After calibration you may test to see if the character spacing
algorithm are providing the correct compensation.
